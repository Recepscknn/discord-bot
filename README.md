# Discord Bot
>When I first opened my Discord server, I realized that I needed to use some bots on the server. These bots had been verified by Discord as trustworthy, but I didn't know how reliable they really were. Additionally, these bots were limiting what we could do. So, I decided to write my own bot to eliminate this uncertainty and remove the limitations.

I hope it is useful for you.

## Features & Services
---
- After creating the bot and connecting the codes, you should use the command ` ./help `.

- To draw lots, you should enter `./kura name1, name2, name3"`.
- To play the number guessing game, you should type `./numbergame`.
- To stop the number guessing game, you should type `./stop`.
- To play rock-paper-scissors, you should type `./taş` or `./kağıt` or `./makas`.
- To have the bot send a random meme, you should type `./meme`.
- To play blackjack, you should type `./blackjack`. (There are some errors in the code, which I will fix.)
